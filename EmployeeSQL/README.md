# Module 9 Challenge: SQL Challenge

#Data Modeling
	#Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables. To create the sketch, feel free to use a tool like QuickDBDLinks to an external site.

#Data Engineering: Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. 
	# Create departments table
	# Create employees table
	# Create Salaries table
	# Create dept_manager table
	# Create dept_emp table
	# Create temp_emplyees table to temporary hold the data because unable to import the csv file for employees table, here treat the birth_date and hire_date column as TEXT to avoid a date parsing error being triggered
	# Import the CSV File into the Temporary Table, and then convert and insert the data into the original employees table
	# Verify the import and drop the Temporary table
	# Create titles table
